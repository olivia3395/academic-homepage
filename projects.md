- **GraphonTrans: Structure-Aware Transfer Learning for Graph Link Prediction**

  *GraphonTrans* is a theoretically grounded transfer learning method designed for **link prediction under graph distribution shift**. In many real-world scenariosâ€”such as social networks, biomedical graphs, or recommender systemsâ€”graphs collected from different domains may differ in density, connectivity, or latent topology, making standard link prediction methods unreliable when transferred.

  Our method leverages **graphon estimation** to recover latent edge probability structures and applies **cross-graph thresholding** to effectively align the structural differences between source and target graphs. We introduce a novel selection mechanism for the optimal transfer threshold via edge-level cross-validation, allowing **adaptive transfer** based on structural similarity.

  âœ… Key contributions include:
  - A formalization of **transfer learning on graphs** via latent graphon models  
  - A new **graphon thresholding strategy** that bridges source-target structure gaps  
  - Edge-level **cross-validation** to select transfer parameters without target supervision  
  - Theoretical guarantees on link prediction error under structure shift

  Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets including **IMDB-BINARY**, **REDDIT-BINARY**, and **COLLAB**, especially when target graphs are small or noisy.
