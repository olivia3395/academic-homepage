- **GraphonTrans: Transfer Learning with Graphon Models for Network Estimation**

  *GraphonTrans* is a transfer learning framework designed to improve the estimation of small networks by leveraging structural knowledge from larger, related graphs. Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric approach for estimating latent edge probability matrices, and are foundational for tasks such as **link prediction** and **graph data augmentation**. However, high-quality graphon estimation usually requires large graphsâ€”posing a challenge when only a small target graph is available. *GraphonTrans* addresses this limitation by aligning the target graph to a related large **source graph** via **Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport**, and then transferring structural information using **neighborhood smoothing** techniques. To safeguard against **negative transfer**, we introduce a **debiasing mechanism** that adapts to target-specific discrepancies by applying residual smoothing corrections. This adaptive component ensures that only compatible structural information is transferred.

- **MKDnet: Multi-level Knowledge Distillation for Spatiotemporal Graph Forecasting**
  *MKDnet* is a multi-scale knowledge distillation framework for improving spatiotemporal forecasting in traffic and mobility networks. To address challenges like sparse data and domain shifts, it employs a hierarchical studentâ€“teacher architecture that transfers informative representations across spatial, temporal, and task levels. The high-capacity teacher captures long-range spatiotemporal patterns, while the lightweight student learns through both **representation-level** and **prediction-level** distillation. By integrating **graph convolutional networks (GCNs)** and **temporal modules** (e.g., GRUs or attention), *MKDnet* effectively models dynamic graph structures. Its **multi-level supervision**â€”from features to outputsâ€”enhances generalization to unseen regions and patterns.
