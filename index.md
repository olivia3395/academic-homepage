## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m **Yuyao Wang**, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), co-advised by [Dr. Debarghya Mukherjee](https://debarghya-mukherjee.github.io/) and [Dr. Luis Carvalho](https://math.bu.edu/people/lecarval/).

My research lies at the intersection of **transfer learning**, **graph mining**, and **nonparametric statistics**, with a focus on building theoretically grounded methods for analyzing structured and heterogeneous data. I'm particularly interested in how statistical theory can inform learning under distributional shifts, and how structural informationâ€”such as graphs, networks, or low-dimensional manifoldsâ€”can be leveraged to improve estimation, inference, and generalization.

My work blends ideas from mathematical statistics, machine learning, and network modeling to develop tools that are both principled and practical. I am especially drawn to methods that operate well in **low-sample**, **high-dimensional**, or **non-IID** settings, often combining graph-theoretic insights with minimax theory and adaptive regularization.

Before joining BU, I earned my M.A. in Statistics from **Columbia University**, and received my B.S. in Mathematics from **Shandong University** as part of the Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program, in collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
