## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m **Yuyao Wang**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Statistics at Boston University**, co-advised by [Debarghya Mukherjee](https://debarghya-mukherjee.github.io/) and [Luis Carvalho](https://math.bu.edu/people/lecarval/).

My research focuses on **transfer learning**, **graph mining**, and **nonparametric statistics**, developing **theoretically grounded methods** for structured and heterogeneous dataâ€”especially in **low-sample, high-dimensional, and non-IID settings**. I blend **statistical theory**, **machine learning**, and **network modeling** to advance estimation, inference, and generalization.

Before BU, I earned my **M.A. in Statistics** at Columbia University and **B.S. in Mathematics** at Shandong University (Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program, with Chinese Academy of Sciences.).
