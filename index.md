Hi! Iâ€™m **Yuyao Wang**, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Boston University, co-advised by Dr. Debarghya Mukherjee and Dr. Luis Carvalho. My research lies at the intersection of transfer learning, graph mining, and nonparametric statistics, with a focus on building theoretically grounded methods for analyzing structured and heterogeneous data.

I'm particularly interested in how statistical theory can inform learning under distributional shifts, and how structural informationâ€”like graphs or manifoldsâ€”can be leveraged to improve estimation and inference. My work blends ideas from mathematical statistics, machine learning, and network modeling to develop tools that are both principled and practical.

Prior to BU, I completed my M.A. in Statistics at Columbia University and received my B.S. in Mathematics from Shandong University, where I was part of the Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program. Across all my work, Iâ€™m driven by a fascination with structure, a respect for theory, and a desire to build tools that generalize.
