Welcome to **Yuyao's Notebook** â€” a digital space where research meets curiosity.

Here I document ideas, findings, and reflections from my journey as a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Boston University.  
My research centers on developing statistically principled and theoretically sound solutions to modern challenges in data science and machine learning.

Iâ€™m especially passionate about:

- **Statistical Machine Learning** â€” designing interpretable models with provable guarantees for complex data
- **Transfer Learning** â€” building adaptive algorithms to leverage knowledge across domains under distributional shifts
- **Graph Mining** â€” modeling and analyzing structured data using graphons, GNNs, and probabilistic frameworks
- **Nonparametric Methods** â€” constructing flexible estimators with minimax-optimal guarantees without strong assumptions
