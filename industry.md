### 💼 Industry Experience

#### 📊 Quantitative Analyst, Guotai Junan Securities Co., Ltd *(Shanghai, China — Jun 2021 to Aug 2021)*

As a summer intern in the **Derivatives Research Division**, I explored cross-asset trading strategies and risk modeling:

* Identified predictive trading signals by combining **Boruta feature selection**, **Lasso regression**, and **Bayesian model averaging**, aiming to uncover stable alpha sources across volatile equity sectors.
* Contributed to the **pricing of structured financial products**, such as equity-linked swaps and options, using **Monte Carlo simulations** with refined path generation and scenario resampling.
* Developed XGBoost and LightGBM models to **forecast option-implied spread movements**, aiding real-time pricing adjustments and trade execution timing.

This experience allowed me to bridge statistical inference with real-world financial risk systems, collaborating closely with quants and traders on multi-dimensional pricing tasks.

#### 🏦 Analyst, Investment Banking Division, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank *(Shanghai, China — Jun 2019 to Aug 2019)*

During my internship in the **Investment Banking Division**, I supported fixed-income issuance and risk modeling:

* Conducted **industry benchmarking** and peer bond analysis for upcoming issuances, employing models like **Nelson-Siegel** and **Svensson** to simulate yield curves and evaluate bond pricing sensitivity under interest rate shifts.
* Designed a **Monte Carlo pricing engine** for customized structured notes, adjusting volatility surfaces and scenario parameters to improve risk-adjusted return estimates.
* Performed volatility modeling using **VaR, CVaR, and GARCH** frameworks, supporting internal stress testing and scenario analysis for the client portfolios.

This role provided early exposure to quantitative risk tools in a regulated banking context, emphasizing the practical integration of econometric methods and financial engineering models.
