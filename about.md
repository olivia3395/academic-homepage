ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Yuyao Wang**, a PhD student in Statistics at Boston University.

Iâ€™m broadly interested in:
- Transfer learning
- Graph mining
- Theoretical machine learning
- Nonparametric inference

Currently, I work on structure-aware statistical models and learning methods across heterogeneous domains. I love integrating mathematical theory with real-world data to drive insights and impact.
