‚ú® Dancing between equations and creativity, where data meets design and insight sparks joy.  
üß† Drawn to patterns, grounded in theory, and always chasing the next ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment‚Äîwhether on paper or a forest trail.  
üìà When statistics gets tangled with storytelling, unexpected beauty unfolds.  
üé® From the elegance of proofs to the thrill of a good photo angle‚Äîthere‚Äôs art in every analysis.

### My Story

I grew up in **Jinan, China**, the *‚ÄúCity of Springs‚Äù*, surrounded by natural beauty, books, and a supportive family. My upbringing was shaped by **art and music**‚Äîfrom piano, calligraphy, and creative writing to a love of **Mandarin R\&B**. I‚Äôve always found joy in **language and storytelling**, while photography, running, and travel keep me grounded today. Outside academia, I enjoy **video editing**, **long-distance running**, and **landscape/travel photography**. I also collect **fridge magnets** from my travels, often inspired by national parks and wild nature.

### My Mathematical Detour
Started with a love for **prime numbers and proofs**, then explored **financial mathematics** through FBSDEs before finding a home in **statistics**, where rigor meets real-world data. Now I bring **proof-driven precision** to complex structures like **graphs, signals, and networks**.

### Pre-Ph.D. Research Experience

Before my Ph.D., I worked on interdisciplinary projects in **urban science**, **deep generative modeling**, **theoretical ML**, and **remote sensing for climate resilience**. These experiences strengthened my **quantitative skills** and my ability to connect **theory with real-world challenges**.

- **Tsinghua University** ‚Äî *Spatial Urban Growth Modeling*

  Collaborated with urban planners to model **land-use change** using **spatial econometrics** and **deep spatiotemporal networks** with satellite and demographic data. Provided **quantitative insights** for infrastructure, transit, and ecological planning.

- **Tsinghua University** ‚Äî *Generative AI for Urban Design*

  Developed a **Conditional GAN** to generate urban block layouts under zoning constraints, integrating a **human-in-the-loop refinement loop** that fused **design thinking with machine learning**.


- **Peking University** ‚Äî *Advancing Normalizing Flows*

  Enhanced **Normalizing Flow models** with new invertible transformations, providing **theoretical guarantees** in high dimensions and validating on **synthetic and simulation data**.



- **Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)** ‚Äî *Multi-Modal Fusion for Disaster Forecasting*

  Led development of a **multi-modal flood prediction system** fusing satellite, sensor, and river topology data. Built **U-Net, CNN-LSTM, and GNN pipelines** to model spatiotemporal patterns, improving **national early-warning platforms** for risk assessment and resource allocation.
