✨ Dancing between equations and creativity, where data meets design and insight sparks joy.  
🧠 Drawn to patterns, grounded in theory, and always chasing the next “aha” moment—whether on paper or a forest trail.  
📈 When statistics gets tangled with storytelling, unexpected beauty unfolds.  
🎨 From the elegance of proofs to the thrill of a good photo angle—there’s art in every analysis.

### 🌿 My Story

I was born and raised in **Jinan, China**, a city known for its natural springs and literary heritage. From a young age, I was immersed in a rich artistic and intellectual environment. I studied **piano**, **vocal music**, **drawing**, **Chinese calligraphy**, and **creative writing** for many years—training that shaped both my sense of discipline and appreciation for aesthetic structure. Reading has always been a quiet passion of mine. Whether it’s classical literature or modern essays, I find deep joy in language and storytelling—skills I carry with me into both writing and data science.

### 🎞️ Outside the Lab

Outside of academic life, I’m an enthusiastic **video editor** and love turning raw moments into polished visual stories. I also enjoy **long-distance running**, especially trail runs through forested paths or coastline routes. My camera is my constant companion—I practice **landscape and travel photography**, and I’ve been steadily building a collection of **fridge magnets** from each place I explore. National parks and wild nature always inspire me, both intellectually and emotionally.

These creative and physical outlets keep me grounded and curious—much like the kind of research I strive to do.

### 📚 Pre-Ph.D. Research Experience

Before beginning my Ph.D., I was fortunate to engage in several interdisciplinary research projects spanning **urban science**, **deep generative modeling**, **theoretical machine learning**, and **remote sensing for climate resilience**. These formative experiences not only sharpened my quantitative skills but also nurtured a strong intuition for connecting theory to real-world challenges.

- **Tsinghua University** — *Spatial Urban Growth Modeling* 
  Collaborated with urban planners and geospatial scientists to develop predictive models of land-use change in rapidly urbanizing regions. I built spatial econometric models (SAR, SLM) and deep spatiotemporal networks (Conv-LSTM) that incorporated both satellite-derived maps and demographic indicators. The resulting system offered quantitative insights into the evolution of built-up land, supporting long-term planning decisions for public infrastructure, transit development, and ecological conservation.

- **Tsinghua University** — *Generative AI for Urban Design*   
  As part of a project exploring AI-human collaboration in design workflows, I created a Conditional GAN architecture to generate plausible urban block layouts conditioned on zoning constraints. The project uniquely fused design thinking with machine learning, introducing a refinement loop where human architects could adjust or override generative outputs.

- **Peking University** — *Advancing Normalizing Flows* 
  At the interface of theory and application, I investigated how to enhance the expressiveness of **Normalizing Flow models** through new invertible transformations. I derived theoretical guarantees for approximation quality and invertibility under high-dimensional settings, and applied the framework to synthetic benchmarks and simulation data from physics and biology.
  
- **Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)** — *Multi-Modal Fusion for Disaster Forecasting*
  Working at the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, I led the development of a multi-modal flood prediction system that fused **satellite imagery**, **sensor networks**, and **topological river maps**. I designed deep learning pipelines using U-Net, CNN-LSTM, and GNNs to capture spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and water levels, validated against historical flood events in Southeast Asia. The results contributed to national early-warning platforms, helping policymakers assess risk and allocate emergency resources more effectively.
