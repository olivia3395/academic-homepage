Hi! I’m **Yuyao Wang (王宇瑶)**, a curious mind shaped equally by statistics and storytelling, theory and aesthetics.  
Born and raised in **Jinan, China**, a city known for its natural springs and literary heritage, I grew up surrounded by ink, melody, and rhythm—spending much of my early years practicing **calligraphy**, **piano**, **painting**, and **creative writing**. These experiences didn’t just teach me skills, but cultivated a deep appreciation for structure, expression, and the quiet discipline of craft—traits that now guide how I approach research, design, and everyday life.

Though I work with data and mathematical models today, I continue to find inspiration in **national parks**, **long-distance running**, and **photography**, where patterns emerge not from equations but from light, motion, and memory. I love turning these moments into visual stories through **video editing**, and I collect **fridge magnets** as small anchors of each journey.

In all things—whether in algorithms or art—I’m drawn to the balance between intuition and precision, and the idea that rigor and creativity need not be opposites.

### 🌿 My Story

From a young age, I was immersed in a rich artistic and intellectual environment. I studied **piano**, **vocal music**, **drawing**, **Chinese calligraphy**, and **creative writing** for many years—training that shaped both my sense of discipline and appreciation for aesthetic structure. Reading has always been a quiet passion of mine. Whether it’s classical literature or modern essays, I find deep joy in language and storytelling—skills I carry with me into both writing and data science.

### 🎞️ Outside the Lab

Outside of academic life, I’m an enthusiastic **video editor** and love turning raw moments into polished visual stories. I also enjoy **long-distance running**, especially trail runs through forested paths or coastline routes. My camera is my constant companion—I practice **landscape and travel photography**, and I’ve been steadily building a collection of **fridge magnets** from each place I explore. National parks and wild nature always inspire me, both intellectually and emotionally.

These creative and physical outlets keep me grounded and curious—much like the kind of research I strive to do.
