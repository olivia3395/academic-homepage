Hi! I‚Äôm **Yuyao Wang (ÁéãÂÆáÁë∂)**, a curious mind shaped equally by statistics and storytelling, theory and aesthetics.  
Born and raised in **Jinan, China**, a city known for its natural springs and literary heritage, I grew up surrounded by ink, melody, and rhythm‚Äîspending much of my early years practicing **calligraphy**, **piano**, **painting**, and **creative writing**. These experiences didn‚Äôt just teach me skills, but cultivated a deep appreciation for structure, expression, and the quiet discipline of craft‚Äîtraits that now guide how I approach research, design, and everyday life.

Though I work with data and mathematical models today, I continue to find inspiration in **national parks**, **long-distance running**, and **photography**, where patterns emerge not from equations but from light, motion, and memory. I love turning these moments into visual stories through **video editing**, and I collect **fridge magnets** as small anchors of each journey.

In all things‚Äîwhether in algorithms or art‚ÄîI‚Äôm drawn to the balance between intuition and precision, and the idea that rigor and creativity need not be opposites.

### üåø My Story

From a young age, I was immersed in a rich artistic and intellectual environment. I studied **piano**, **vocal music**, **drawing**, **Chinese calligraphy**, and **creative writing** for many years‚Äîtraining that shaped both my sense of discipline and appreciation for aesthetic structure. Reading has always been a quiet passion of mine. Whether it‚Äôs classical literature or modern essays, I find deep joy in language and storytelling‚Äîskills I carry with me into both writing and data science.

### üéûÔ∏è Outside the Lab

Outside of academic life, I‚Äôm an enthusiastic **video editor** and love turning raw moments into polished visual stories. I also enjoy **long-distance running**, especially trail runs through forested paths or coastline routes. My camera is my constant companion‚ÄîI practice **landscape and travel photography**, and I‚Äôve been steadily building a collection of **fridge magnets** from each place I explore. National parks and wild nature always inspire me, both intellectually and emotionally.

These creative and physical outlets keep me grounded and curious‚Äîmuch like the kind of research I strive to do.

### üìö Pre-Ph.D. Research Experience

Before beginning my Ph.D., I was fortunate to engage in several interdisciplinary research projects spanning **urban science**, **deep generative modeling**, **theoretical machine learning**, and **remote sensing for climate resilience**. These formative experiences not only sharpened my quantitative skills but also nurtured a strong intuition for connecting theory to real-world challenges.

- **Tsinghua University** ‚Äî *Spatial Urban Growth Modeling* 
  Collaborated with urban planners and geospatial scientists to develop predictive models of land-use change in rapidly urbanizing regions. I built spatial econometric models (SAR, SLM) and deep spatiotemporal networks (Conv-LSTM) that incorporated both satellite-derived maps and demographic indicators. The resulting system offered quantitative insights into the evolution of built-up land, supporting long-term planning decisions for public infrastructure, transit development, and ecological conservation.

- **Tsinghua University** ‚Äî *Generative AI for Urban Design*   
  As part of a project exploring AI-human collaboration in design workflows, I created a Conditional GAN architecture to generate plausible urban block layouts conditioned on zoning constraints. The project uniquely fused design thinking with machine learning, introducing a refinement loop where human architects could adjust or override generative outputs. This work inspired my enduring interest in *human-in-the-loop systems*, as well as in aligning ML outputs with social, aesthetic, and regulatory criteria.

- **Peking University** ‚Äî *Advancing Normalizing Flows* 
  At the interface of theory and application, I investigated how to enhance the expressiveness of **Normalizing Flow models** through new invertible transformations. I derived theoretical guarantees for approximation quality and invertibility under high-dimensional settings, and applied the framework to synthetic benchmarks and simulation data from physics and biology. This experience deepened my understanding of **density modeling**, **manifold learning**, and **Bayesian generative inference**, forming the basis for my current work on transfer learning with distributional shifts.

- **Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)** ‚Äî *Multi-Modal Fusion for Disaster Forecasting*
  Working at the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, I led the development of a multi-modal flood prediction system that fused **satellite imagery**, **sensor networks**, and **topological river maps**. I designed deep learning pipelines using U-Net, CNN-LSTM, and GNNs to capture spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and water levels, validated against historical flood events in Southeast Asia. The resulting system contributed to national early-warning platforms, helping policymakers assess risk and allocate emergency resources more effectively.
