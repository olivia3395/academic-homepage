### 🌿 My Story

I grew up in **Jinan, China**—a city poetically known as *“the City of Springs”*, where clear artesian waters ripple through willow-lined streets and stone bridges. It’s a place steeped in **natural beauty**, **literary tradition**, and **a calm, steady rhythm** that shaped my early years. The sounds of gurgling springs, street vendors selling candied hawthorn, and children’s laughter in banyan-shaded courtyards form a soundtrack I still carry with me.

I was fortunate to be surrounded by a warm and encouraging family—my parents nurtured my curiosity with stacks of books and open-ended questions. My closest childhood friends were the kind you share secret diaries with. In my spare time, I’m a devoted fan of **Mandarin R&B**—I grew up listening to the smooth vocals of **Leehom Wang**, **David Tao**, and **Khalil Fong**, and I still get a rush of nostalgia whenever those classic tracks come on. 

Art and music were central to my upbringing. I trained in **piano**, **vocal performance**, **ink painting**, **Chinese calligraphy**, and **creative writing** for many years—forms that taught me not just technique, but patience, precision, and the beauty of structure. I spent countless quiet evenings practicing scales or composing short stories, often lost in a world of rhythm and narrative.

Reading became my quiet rebellion and lifelong companion. Whether it was Tang poetry or modern prose, fiction or essays, I found joy in **language’s ability to build bridges—between people, cultures, or simply moments of thought**. 

Of course, not everything in life is smooth sailing—especially when it involves heights or water! I have a **serious fear of heights** and have yet to conquer my lifelong inability to **swim**. Still, I believe every fear has a story, and someday I might trade my panic for paddling—just... not today!

### 🧮 My Mathematical Detour

My journey into statistics didn’t begin with data—it began with **prime numbers and proofs**. Later, my mathematical compass pointed toward **financial mathematics**, where I dove into the deep waters of **forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs)** for my thesis. Eventually, I found my intellectual home in **statistics**: a place where rigor meets randomness, and where math has room to dance with the real world. These days, I bring that same proof-loving precision into messy, structured data—whether it’s graphs, signals, or networks with personality.

From primes to probabilities, it’s been quite the ride—and I’m still loving the curveballs.

### 🎞️ Outside the Lab

Outside of academic life, I’m an enthusiastic **video editor** and love turning raw moments into polished visual stories. I also enjoy **long-distance running**, especially trail runs through forested paths or coastline routes. My camera is my constant companion—I practice **landscape and travel photography**, and I’ve been steadily building a collection of **fridge magnets** from each place I explore. National parks and wild nature always inspire me, both intellectually and emotionally.

These creative and physical outlets keep me grounded and curious—much like the kind of research I strive to do.

### 📚 Pre-Ph.D. Research Experience

Before beginning my Ph.D., I was fortunate to engage in several interdisciplinary research projects spanning **urban science**, **deep generative modeling**, **theoretical machine learning**, and **remote sensing for climate resilience**. These formative experiences not only sharpened my quantitative skills but also nurtured a strong intuition for connecting theory to real-world challenges.

- **Tsinghua University** — *Spatial Urban Growth Modeling*  
  Collaborated with urban planners and geospatial scientists to develop predictive models of land-use change in rapidly urbanizing regions. I built spatial econometric models and deep spatiotemporal networks that incorporated both satellite-derived maps and demographic indicators. The resulting system offered quantitative insights into the evolution of built-up land, supporting long-term planning decisions for public infrastructure, transit development, and ecological conservation.

- **Tsinghua University** — *Generative AI for Urban Design*  
  As part of a project exploring AI-human collaboration in design workflows, I created a Conditional GAN architecture to generate plausible urban block layouts conditioned on zoning constraints. The project uniquely fused design thinking with machine learning, introducing a refinement loop where human architects could adjust or override generative outputs.

- **Peking University** — *Advancing Normalizing Flows*  
  At the interface of theory and application, I investigated how to enhance the expressiveness of Normalizing Flow models through new invertible transformations. I derived theoretical guarantees for approximation quality and invertibility under high-dimensional settings, and applied the framework to synthetic benchmarks and simulation data.

- **Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)** — *Multi-Modal Fusion for Disaster Forecasting*  
  Working at the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, I led the development of a multi-modal flood prediction system that fused satellite imagery, sensor networks, and topological river maps. I designed deep learning pipelines using U-Net, CNN-LSTM, and GNNs to capture spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and water levels, validated against historical flood events in China. The results contributed to national early-warning platforms, helping policymakers assess risk and allocate emergency resources more effectively.
