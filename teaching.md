### 🎓 Teaching Experience

Since joining Boston University, I’ve had the pleasure of serving as a **Teaching Assistant** for multiple undergraduate and graduate-level statistics courses. I enjoy helping students build mathematical intuition and confidence in applying statistical methods across theory and practice.

#### 📘 Courses TA’d at Boston University

- **MA 113** — Elementary Statistics  
- **MA 115** — Statistics I  
- **MA 213** — Basic Statistics and Probability  
- **MA 582** — Mathematical Statistics

I’ve supported students through lectures, office hours, exam reviews, and hands-on coding practice using R and Python. In recognition of my contributions, I was honored to receive the **Best TA Award**—an acknowledgment I’m deeply grateful for.

Teaching has been a core part of my academic life, and I strive to create a supportive and engaging learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and exploring ideas.
